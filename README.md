# Prework Study Guide



## Description

I made this to show that I could for a class I'm taking. The basic nature of the exersises made it hard to get though not because of a dificulty of adding what they wanted but rather the incredibly handholdy way that it was set up. Through this I had to take multiple breaks because the simplicity was boring me to no end. Anyway here is the finished product.


## Installation

This is an HTML webpage if you dont know how to open that I am suprised your on github


## Usage
As stated in the description this is mostly just to show that I can do this so theres not much you need to know to use this. The console has a bit in it becasue they wanted the js to only do that or something. Other than that its just a webpage.


## Credits

Most of the content for this was made by lernantio except the CSS which I used to take a break from the monotany and customized


## License

Do whatever you want with this if your really want I do not care the official Licence is in the repo though.
